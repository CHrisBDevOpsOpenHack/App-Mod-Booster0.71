Build an ASP.NET Razor Pages application in C# that recreates the functionality shown in the screenshots in the Legacy-Screenshots folder.

## Application Structure

Organise the code following standard ASP.NET conventions:

- **Pages/**: Razor Pages for the user interface (Index.cshtml, AddExpense.cshtml, etc.)
- **Controllers/**: API controllers for data operations
- **Models/**: Data models representing database entities (can use a single ExpenseModels.cs file)
- **Services/**: Business logic and data access through stored procedures
- **wwwroot/**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript)

## User Interface Requirements

The main Index page should provide clear navigation to all the standard database operations like adding records, viewing data, and filtering results. Aim for a clean, modern user interface that's intuitive and responsive.

## Technology Requirements

Target .NET 8 (the current Long Term Support version):

    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>

The application uses a user-assigned managed identity to connect to Azure SQL Database - no connection strings with passwords. See prompt-008-use-existing-db for connection string configuration.

## Data Access

All database operations should go through the Services layer, which calls stored procedures. Never construct SQL queries directly in the application code. See prompt-024-sqlcmd-stored-procedures for the stored procedure patterns.

## Critical: Column Name Alignment

When mapping SQL results to C# model properties, the column names in `reader.GetOrdinal("ColumnName")` must EXACTLY match what the stored procedures return. Check stored-procedures.sql for the actual column aliases:

- The stored procedure returns `AmountDecimal` (not `Amount`) - map this to the model's `Amount` property
- The stored procedure returns `ReviewedByName` (not `ReviewerName`) - map this to the model's `ReviewerName` property

Example of correct mapping:
```csharp
Amount = reader.GetDecimal(reader.GetOrdinal("AmountDecimal")),
ReviewerName = reader.IsDBNull(reader.GetOrdinal("ReviewedByName")) ? null : reader.GetString(reader.GetOrdinal("ReviewedByName")),
```

Getting these names wrong causes "Unable to cast object" or "column not found" runtime errors.

## Health Check Endpoint

The application MUST include a `/health` endpoint for App Service health probes. This endpoint must NOT depend on the database — it should return HTTP 200 immediately.

In `Program.cs`:
```csharp
// Add health checks (no DB dependency)
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();

// ... later, after app.UseAuthorization() ...

app.MapHealthChecks("/health");
```

Without this, App Service will health-check the root URL (`/`) which requires database access. If the database is slow or unavailable during deployment, the app fails to start within 10 minutes.

## NuGet Package Versions

Use these specific versions to avoid runtime issues on Linux App Service:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" Version="5.2.2" />
```

**Important:** Version 5.1.x fails on Linux with "Connection reset by peer" due to OpenSSL 3.0 TLS incompatibility.
