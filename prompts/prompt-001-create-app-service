Create the Bicep code for an Azure App Service in the UK South region.

Use the Standard S1 pricing tier to avoid cold start delays when the site launches.

All Azure resource names in the Bicep files must be lowercase - never use uppercase characters in resource names.

Save this as `deploy-infra/modules/app-service.bicep` and make sure the main template at `deploy-infra/main.bicep` can call it as a module.

This prompt is for infrastructure only - we're creating the App Service resource itself, not deploying any application code to it.

## Health Check Configuration

The App Service MUST configure a health check path in siteConfig:

```bicep
siteConfig: {
  healthCheckPath: '/health'
  // ... other settings
}
```

This tells App Service to probe `/health` instead of the root URL during deployment. The application provides a simple `/health` endpoint that returns HTTP 200 without database dependencies, ensuring the app can start successfully even if the database connection is slow.
