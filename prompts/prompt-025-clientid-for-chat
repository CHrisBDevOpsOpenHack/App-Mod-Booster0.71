Make sure to add the AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable to the App Service configuration:


az webapp config appsettings set \  --name app-expensemgmt-gxhhiip6yw7iw \  --resource-group rg-expensemgmt-demo \  --settings "AZURE_CLIENT_ID=976d9ad4-1e44-4efa-837a-5cd714ae4a8d"
This was needed because:

The App Service uses a user-assigned managed identity (not system-assigned)
The DefaultAzureCredential in the code needs to know which managed identity to use when there are multiple identities
Setting AZURE_CLIENT_ID tells DefaultAzureCredential to use the specific managed identity with that client ID
This allows the ChatService to authenticate with Azure OpenAI using the managed identity
Without this setting, you got the error: "Unable to load the proper Managed Identity" because DefaultAzureCredential couldn't determine which identity to use.
